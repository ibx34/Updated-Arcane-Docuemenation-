# Getting Started

!!! tip "Should my server use leveling?"
    Some servers should probably not use our leveling feature. If you want to increase activity in your server this may be the feature you're looking for. 

!!! error "Permissions"
    Arcane requires a few permissions for leveling to work. Arcane requires `Send messages, embed links, attach images, and view channel`. If Arcane doesn't have any of these permissions some commands may fail to work.
