# Server Configuration

!!! error "Permissions"
    Arcane cannot give out role rewards unless it has the `Manage Role` permission **and** Arcane's **highest** role is above the role rewards. 

## Configuring Your Server

!!! info 
    To start configuring your server please refer to the [Dashboard](/dashboard/getting-started) documentation. Once you have read through that please continue on with this page. It provides some basic understanding of Arcane's dashboard which will be required to know in this guide. 

## Role Rewards

Role rewards provide an incentive to be active in your server. When a user reaches a level Arcane will give them a role as a reward. You don't need to do exactly how we show rewards. You can create different roles with different names. We have no limits to how many rewards you can create. Your only limit is discord. ðŸ˜€ An example of some rewards:

| Level | Role Reward |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 1     | Novice      |
| 10    | Beginner    |
| 50    | Master      |
| 150   | Instructor  |

### Adding a Reward

Once you are into Arcane's [dashboard](https://arcanebot.xyz/dashboard), find your server and select it. You will be greeted with a list of modules which you can configure. Role rewards can be found in the leveling module. You may need to enable the Leveling Module by clicking `enable`. To create a reward you select a role from the dropdown menu and then enter the level it should be given at. Once you are happy with your selection click the `Add Reward` button.

## Common Mistakes

Many users who invite the bot do not correctly setup their roles. When you invite Arcane your role menu in discord may look like this:

!!! hint 
    Arcane's role is below the Reward Roles. Arcane cannot give these roles even if Arcane has the `Manage Roles` permission. Simply move Arcane's role above the other roles and Arcane will be able to give out the rewards properly.
